# Generalized-propensity-score
# This project estimating the effects of nutrients on stream invertebrates from observational data using the method of generalized propensity score
# The methodology generally follow:
# Hirano, K., and G. W. Imbens. 2004. The propensity score with continuous treatments. Missing data and bayesian methods in practice: contributions by Donald Rubin's statistical family.
# The data tested here are collected by the USEPA at wadeable stream reaches from 12 western U.S. states.
# The orignal dataset are available here:https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/wadeable-streams-assessment
# We also provide a cleaned data subset used in my paper:The effects of nutrients on stream invertebrates: A regional estimation by generalized propensity score
