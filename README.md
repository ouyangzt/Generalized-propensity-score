# Generalized-propensity-score
This project estimating the effects of nutrients on stream invertebrates from observational data using the method of generalized propensity score
The methodology generally follow: Hirano, K., and G. W. Imbens. 2004. The propensity score with continuous treatments. Missing data and bayesian methods in practice: contributions by Donald Rubin's statistical family.
The data tested here are collected by the USEPA at wadeable stream reaches from 12 western U.S. states.
The orignal dataset are available here:https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/wadeable-streams-assessment
We also provide a cleaned data subset used in my paper:The effects of nutrients on stream invertebrates: A regional estimation by generalized propensity score
